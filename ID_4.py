#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#This seems pretty easy to me, just multiply the numbers (all three digits?) and then string split them and check
#for equality when reversed.

#100 to 999

#Very similar - it also use my function name as I had asked a question about it. I notice it uses a tuple for the factors which is smart.
